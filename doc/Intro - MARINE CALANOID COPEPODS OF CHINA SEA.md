# **INTRODUCTION**

Calanoid copepods are a well-recognized taxonomic group of Crustacea.  They were already placed, with one cyclopoid (*Scribella*) and five calanoid (*Acartia, Calanus, Candacia, Euchirus *(= *Euchaeta*)*, *and *Pontella*)* *genera, under a single taxonomic unit, the Calanidae, by Dana (1846).  Giesbrecht and Sars are the two early principal contributors to the taxonomy of Copepoda, including the Calanoida.

Based on the location of the body articulation, Giesbrecht (1883) divided copepods into two groups, the Gymnopleoden and Podopleoden.  All copepods, characterized by an articulation between the fifth pedigerous (leg-bearing) somite and genital somite, separating the body into an anterior part (prosome) and a posterior part (urosome), were placed under the suborder Gymnoplea.  Podoplea contained all other copepods having this articulation located between the fourth and fifth pedigerous somites.  According to the structure of antennules in males, Giesbrecht further divided the Gymnoplea into two tribes, the Amphaskandria (males with both antennules similar) and Heterarthrandria (males with one of the antennules modified).

Sars (1901-1903), on the other hand, suggested seven distinct types of copepods, *Calanus, Harpacticus, Cyclops, Notodelphys, Monstrilla, Caligus, *and *Lernaea*, respectively respresenting seven divisions (Suborders) of the Copepoda, i.e., Calanoida, Harpacticoida, Cyclopoida, Notodelphyoida, Monstrilloida, Caligoida, and Lernaeoida.  The Calanoida in Sars (1901-1903), corresponding to the Gymnoplea in Giesbrecht (1883), was divided into three sections: Amphascandria (both antennules in males are alike and only transformed slightly without any genicular structure, in the greater number of the genera the adult males are distinguished by a conspicuous transformation and great reduction in oral parts), Isokerandria (both antennules are without any conspicuous difference and oral part of much the same appearance in the two sexes), and Heterarthrandria (one of the antennules in male similar to that in female, the other peculiarly transformed into a powerful grasping organ).

Modifications of classification within the Calanoida have then been proposed and were reviewed by Huy & Boxshall (1991).  In 1974, Andronov proposed the phylogenetic relationships of the higher taxa within the Order Calanoida, and included nine superfamilies: Augapatiloidea, Bathypontioidea, Centropagoidea, Eucalanoidea, Megacalanoidea, Platycopioidea, Pseudocyclopoidea, Pseudocalanoidea, and Riocalanoidea.  As the results of Andronov’s (1991) change of names of some superfamilies to conform with the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature and subsequently Boxshall and Halsey’s (2004) amendment, the Order Calanoida now consists of ten superfamilies and 43 families (30 families, highlighted in red color, present in the China seas ): **Order Calanoida Sars, 1903** (30; 105; 560)(= number of families, genera and species occurring in the China seas)

Calalnoid copepods are the dominant taxa in marine zooplankton and are often being the focal point in various biological and oceanographic studies, for which reliable species identification is required.  The present project aims to provide basic taxonomic information of the species of calanoid copepods occurring in the China seas, i.e., Bohai Sea, Yellow Sea, East China Sea, Taiwan Strait, South China Sea, and east of Taiwan.  The website,* *[http://copepodes.obs-banyuls.fr/en](http://copepodes.obs-banyuls.fr/en), *managed by Razouls, C., F. de Bovée, J. Kouwenberg & N. Desreumaux (2005-2919)*, has been frequently consulted.

# **MORPHOLOGY OF THE CALANOIDA**

Unless otherwise mentioned, all morphological terms here follow Huy and Boxshall (1991).  The following description is mainly based on *Calanus sinicus*, the dominant calanoid species in the China seas.

The calanoid copepods in general are small in size; mostly the body length is under 3 mm, frequently it may be less than 1 mm, and occasionally up to or slightly over 10 mm in some genera.  The body of calanoids consists of the prosome (the anterior part, including cephalosome and thorax) and urosome (the posterior part) which are separated by an articulation between the 5th or the last pedigerous somite of thorax and the genital somite of urosome (text-fig. 1).

**Prosome**:

The prosome contains cephalosome and thorax.  The cephalosome, or head, is formed by the fusion of the five cephalic somites and the first thoracic somite.  Each somite in the cephalosome bears a pair of appendages on its ventral surface.  These appendages, from front backward, are: antennule, antenna, mandible, maxillule, maxilla, and maxilliped.  Among these appendages, antennule, maxilla, and maxilliped are uniramous (branchless) and antenna, mandible, and maxillule are biramous (two branches).  Basically a biramous appendage is composed of a proximal uniramous protopod (2-segmented, the proximal segment, coxa and the distal segment, basis) and a pair of distal biramous rami (the lateral branch, exopod and the medial branch, endopod).  On the front of cephalosome there is a median projection between the antennules, the rostrum, which is divided distally into a pair of rostral filaments.  The thorax has seven somites, including the first six pedigerous (leg carrying) somites and the last limbless somite.  The 1st pair of these legs is the maxilliped, the next five pairs are the 1st to 5th swimming legs.  The 5th swimming legs may be absent in females of some genera and usually exhibit distinct sexual dimorphism.  The first pedigerous somite is incorporated with the cephalosome and the last and limbless somite forms the first somite in urosome.  Further fusion of thoracic somites sometimes may reduce the prosome from six to five or four segments.

**Urosome**:

The urosome is 5-segmented, including the 7th thoracic somite or the genital somite (first urosomite) and the anal somite (last urosomite).  In female the genital somite is fused with the following urosomite to form the genital double somite, resulting in the difference of the number of segmentation between male and female of the same species.  Additional fusion of urosomites may reduce the urosome to 3 or 2 segments.  The urosomites are free of appendages; a pair of setiferous appendages, the caudal rami, is attached to the posterior surface of anal somite.

**Structure of appendages**:

Antennule (text-fig. 1) is 25-segmented in female, 24-segmented and not geniculate in male, bearing seta and aesthetasc (a simple sensory filament) on the segments.  Segments 8 and 9 are partially fused.  Aesthetasc is present on all segments except on segments 21 and 24.

Antenna (text-fig. 3) has 2-segmented protopod, coxa (with 1 seta) and basis (with 2 setae). The biramous rami contains a 7-segmented exopod, with setation formula: 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4 and a 2-segmented endopod with bilobular distal segment, having setation formula 2, 8 (medial lobe)+8 (terminal lobe).

Mandible (text-fig. 4) is formed by a proximal large gnathobase (coxa), and a distal palp.  The gnathobase bears several teeth on its medial margin.  The palp is composed of the basis (with 4 setae), 2-segmented endopod, with 4 and 10 setae, and 5-segmented exopod, with setation formula: 1, 1, 1, 1, 2.

Maxillule (text-fig. 5) is the most complicate cephalic appendage.  Its protopod is 3-segmented and consists of a well-developed praecoxal arthrite with 9 spines on medial margin, 4 setae on posterior surface and 1 seta on anterior surface; coxa with 4 setae on endite (medial lobular structure) and 8 setae on epipodite (lateral lobular structure); basis with exite (lateral lobular structure) bearing 1 seta, and proximal and distal endites, each of which carries 4 setae.  The praecoxal arthrite and endites of coxa (one) and basis (two) are also named the first to fourth inner lobes in literature.  Endopod is 3-segmented with setation formula: 4, 4, 7.  One-segmented exopod carries 11 setae.

Maxilla (text-fig. 6) is comprised of precoxa, coxa, basis, and 3-segmented endopod.  The segmentation is not distinct.  Precoxa and coxa are partially fused; each of the proximal and distal precoxal endites and proximal and distal coxal endites bears, respectively, 5, 3, 3, 3 setae, coxal epipodite is represented by a seta; basis bears 4 setae.  Setation formula for endopodal segments is 2, 2, 2.[to be verified]

Maxilliped (text-fig. 7) is the first thoracic leg.  It comprises syncoxa (fusion of precoxa and coxa, with a setation formula of 1, 2, 4, 4), basis (with 3 setae), and 6-segmented endopod with setation formula 2, 4, 4, 3, 3+1, 4.  The first endopodal segment is partially fused with the basis.

The swimming leg (text-fig. 8) is typically composed of a uniramous 2-segmented protopod, including coxa (the proximal segment) and basis (the distal segment), and a distal pair (biramous) of 3-segmented rami, the exopod (lateral branch) and the endopod (medial branch).  The medial margin of coxa in swimming leg 5 is armed with more than 16 compacted teeth in the genus *Calanus*.  The spine (in Romanic) and seta (in Arabic) formula of the swimming legs 1-5 is as follows:

**Morphological variations**

The front profile of head is usually smooth and rounded, a median structure, such as a sharp dorsal median spine, is present in a number of genera, e.g., *Gaetanus *(text-fig. 9=fig. 175), or a keel-shaped chitinous crest in some genera, e.g.,* Scolecocalanus* (text-fig. 10=fig. 144).  The lateral sides of the cephalosome usually are slightly convex in contour, in some genera, especially those of the Pontellidae, e.g., *Pontella *(text-fig. 11), a lateral hook may present on each side of the head.  The structure of rostrum and its filaments also vary significantly, e.g. singly pointed in *Gaetanus* (text-fig. 12=fig. 194), stout with 2 sausage-like filaments in *Bathycalanus *(text-fig. 13=fig. 55), shallow plate with 2 digitiform filaments in *Pseudoamallothrix *(text-fig. 14=fig. 134), lingular, terminal margin with 2 short pointed processes in *Racovitzanus *(text-fig. 15=fig. 159), bifurcate, short, and solid in *Parvocalanus* (text-fig. 16=fig. 116), etc.

Appendages of the cephalosome also show some degrees of morphological variations.

Antennule: Setae are unusually plumose, e.g., *Pontellina* (text-fig. 17=fig. 222), or long, e.g., *Paraeuchaeta* (text-fig. 18).  One of the antennules is geniculate in male, e.g., *Centropages* (text-fig. 19=fig. 34).

Antenna: Basis is generally separated from exopod and endopod, but in some genera it is fused with segment 1 of endopod, forming an allobasis, e.g., in *Acartia *(text-fig. 20).  Exopod and endopod are usually subequal in length, but in some genera, mostly of the Aetideidae, exopod is 2 times or more as long as endopod, e.g., *Euchirella *(text-fig. 21=fig. 197); in other genera endopod may be 2 times or more as long as exopod, e.g., *Acartia* (text-fig. 20). Number of segments in exopod varies, generally from 6 to 8, but 3-segmented in *Acartiella* (text-fig. 22).

Mandible: General appearance and number of teeth are variable in gnathobase, for example, it may transform to an elongate rod-like structure in *Pseudaugaptilus* (text-fig. 23=fig. 62), number of teeth may reduce to 2 large teeth with a small tooth in between in *Centraugaptilus* (text-fig. 24=fig. 59).  Exopod is usually inserted terminally on basis, but at mid-length in *Eucalanus* (text-fig. 25=fig. 98).

Maxillule: Reduction and transformation of segmentation of maxillule are seen in a large number of genera.  Apparent change is noted in the genus *Augaptilus*, having the appendage reduced to a 3-segmented rod (text fig. 26=fig. 57); in *Arietellus* (text-fig. 27=fig. 46), exopod is overwhelmingly developed, being the largest part of the maxillule while endopod is reduced to a small bulb-like structure.  Missing some parts of the appendage occurs frequently, e.g., in *Tortanus*, basis, exopod and endopod are completely absent (text-fig. 28); in *Subeucalanus,* coxal endite disappears (text-fig. 29=fig. 97).  Sometimes setae transform into spines, e.g., in *Mesorhabdus* one seta of the precoxal arthrite modifies to form a strong and large spine (text-fig. 30=fig. 48).

Maxilla: Morphological modification exhibits significantly in the characteristics of setae of various components of the appendage.  Some setae of basis or endopod transform into spines, e.g. *Hemirhabdus* (text-fig. 31=fig. 47); endopod is ending in a fortified claw, e.g., *Onchocalanus* (text-fig. 32=fig. 131); setae of endopod are similar to worm or brush, e.g. *Onchocalanus *(text-fig. 33=fig. 162); or some endites are missing, e.g. *Hemirhabdus* (text-fig. 34=fig. 51).

Maxilliped: Some setae of maxilliped are armed with shield-like structure, e.g., *Centraugaptilus* (text-fig. 35=fig. 61).  In some genera of the Scolecitrichidae, e.g., *Scaphocalanus* (text-fig. 36), the seta of middle endite of coxa has mushroom-like terminal; significant reduction including segmentation and armature occurs in the genera of the Acartiidae, e.g., *Acartiella* (text-fig. 37) and Tortanidae, e.g., *Tortanus* (text-fig. 38).

Legs 1-4 in general have 3-segmented endopod and exopod; but the segmentation may be reduced to 2 (e.g., *Labidocera*) or 1 (*Macandrewella*) in endopod and to 2 (e.g., *Euchirella*) in exopod of leg 1; to 2 (e.g., *Valdiviella*) or 1 (e.g.,*Chiridiella*) in endopod of leg 2; and to 2 (e.g. *Tortanus*) in endopod of legs 3 and 4.

Leg 5 is the most variable among all legs and is sexually dimorphic.  In females, leg 5 varies from biramous and similar to legs 1-4 (e.g., *Calanus*) to a single knob-like structure (e.g., *Bestiolina*, text-fig. 39=fig. 111) or entirely absent (e.g., *Scolecithrix*).  Different degrees of variation are present: biramous but with different number of segments: 3-segmented exopod and 2-segmented endopod (e.g.,*Lucicutia*), 2-segmented (e.g., *Euaugaptilus*) or 1-segmented (e.g., *Acartiella*) in both exopod and endopod.  In genera with uniramous leg 5, the number of segments may vary from 5 (e.g., *Nullosetigera*, text-fig. 40=fig. 35), to 4 (e.g., *Pseudodiaptomus*, text-fig. 41=fig. 18), 3 (e.g., *Arietellus*, text-fig. 42=fig. 37), 2 (e.g., *Paracalanus*, text-fig. 43=fig. 114) or 1 (e.g., *Paraugaptilus*, text-fig. 44=fig. 36).

Variation in leg 5 is much more pronounced in male than in female.  Rarely leg 5 of male is nearly identical to leg 5 of female (e.g., *Euaugaptilus*, text-fig. 45=fig. 67).  Sometimes one leg is similar to leg 5 of female and the other leg is modified slightly (e.g., *Calanus*, text-fig. 46=fig. 17) or greatly forming a chela (e.g., *Centropages*, text-fig. 47).  Sometimes both legs 5 are about the same size and biramous with 3-segmented exopod and endopod but different slightly in form (e.g., *Mesorhabdus*, text-fig. 48=fig. 75).  In some genera legs 5 may be biramous but are totally different in form from leg 5 of female of the same species (e.g., *Scaphocalanus*, text-fig. 49=fig. 145).  In other genera, one leg is biramous and the other leg is uniramous (e.g., *Temoropia*, text-fig. 50=fig. 89), uniramous on both legs (e.g., *Eucalanus*, text-fig. 51=fig. 93), or uniramous on one side and absent on the other (e.g., *Subeucalanus*, text-fig. 52=fig. 92)

**# TAXONOMY OF CALANOIDA**

General discussion of the taxonomy of calanoid copepods from the levels of genus up to superfamily is available in Boxshall & Halsey (2004).  Some monographs or articles of faunistic studies are important in calanoid taxonomy.  These include Sars (1901-1903, North Atlantic: Norwegian Sea; 1925, North Atlantic and Mediterranean), Breemen (1908, northern North Atlantic and North Sea), With (1915, northern North Atlantic), Rose (1933, Mediterranean and eastern North Atlantic), Giesbrecht (1893, Mediterranean Sea), Vives & Shmeleva (2007, eastern North Atlantic off Portugal), Vervoort (1963, 1965, eastern tropical Atlantic), Harding (2004, western N Atlantic off Canada), Wilson (1932a and b, western North Atlantic: Woods Hole region and Chesapeake Bay), Owre & Foyo (1967, Florida Current, western North Atlantic), Campos Hernández & Suárez Morales (1994, Gulf of Mexico & Caribbean Sea), Bradford-Grieve et al.

(2005-2019) set up a website ([http://copepodes.obs-banyuls.fr/en](http://copepodes.obs-banyuls.fr/en)) to cover taxonomy and distribution of marine copepods of the world.

Taxonomic studies on marine copepods of the China seas were reviewed by Chen, Q. (1986) and Shih & Young (1995).  Major taxonomic studies on the marine Calanoida of the area are Shen & Bai (1956), Shen & Lee (1963), Chen, Q. & Zhang (1965), Zheng et al.

Research in calanoid copepods of the China seas has been relatively active in the last two decades.  Using Shih and Young (1995) as a reference point, the numbers of family, genus and species reported from the China seas have been increased significantly from 27, 72 and 295 in 1995, respectively, to 30, 106 and 562 currently. 

**# DISTRIBUTION**

Distribution of calanoid copepods in the China seas is strongly affected by the oceanic currents (text-fig. 2) and the East Asian seasonal monsoons.  Monsoon changes wind direction, northeasterly in October to April and southwesterly in the remainder of the year, and therefore affects the direction and strength of oceanic currents.

The North Equatorial Current in the Pacific Ocean travels westward near Equator, runs into the Philippine coast, and divides into two branches: the northward Kuroshio and southward Mindanao currents. The Kuroshio, a western boundary current of the North Pacific and equivalent to the Gulf Stream in the North Atlantic Ocean, flows northward along the east coast of Taiwan and continental slope of the East China Sea, and finally turns northeastward then eastward to travel south of Japan (Qiu et al., 2015).  Along its northward path, the Kuroshio makes three westward intrusions, from south to north, 1) through the Luzon Strait into the South China Sea and Taiwan Strait, 2) through a sill between the Taiwan island and southwestern end of the Ryukyu Islands into the southern East China Sea, 3) at the continental slope southwest of Kyushu into the northern East China Sea (Lie & Cho, 2016)

All China seas, except the South China Sea, are shallow and mostly limited to continental shelf. The South China Sea with an average depth of 1,200 meters.  Hu et al (2000) reviewed the oceanic circulation in the South China Sea.  According to Fang et al. (1998), has four major currents in the 0-400 m layer, i.e., the Nansha Western Coastal Current (NWCC), the Nansha Eastern Coastal Current (NECC), the North Nansha Current (NNC), and the Nansha Counter-wind Current (NCC), which (except NECC) are significantly affected by monsoons.  In the northeastern South China Sea a northeastward counter-wind current, the South China Sea Warm Current (SCSWC), is a strong and narrow current throughout winter in the open sea off the Guangdong Province.  It extends northward along the west coast of the southern Taiwan Strait in summer (Hu and Liu 1992).  While travelling northward, a branch of the Kuroshio penetrates through Luzon Strait into the South China Sea. This Kuroshio intrusion has impact on copepod distribution in the South China Sea and Taiwan Strait.

Taiwan Strait is a shallow passage, 60 m in average depth, between the island of Taiwan on the east and mainland China on the west and connects the South China Sea to the East China Sea.  The southward China Coastal Current (CCC) dominants on the west of the Strait and, on the east, the two northward currents, South China Sea Warm Current (SCSWC) dominates in summer and Kuroshio Branch Current (KBC) dominates in other seasons. These currents are heavily influenced by the forcing of annual cycle of monsoons, reinforcing the northward currents in summer but southward current in other seasons (Jan et al. 2002).

The oceanic circulation in the East China Sea and Yellow Sea is basically composed of two systems: 1) on the east and northward flowing: Kuroshio in the Okinawa Trough and its two branches (Western Kuroshio Branch, WKB and Eastern Kuroshio Branch, EKB) over the outer shelf and 2) on the west and southward flowing in winter and weakening or changing to northward flowing in summer: the China Coastal Current (a general term for all coastal currents along Chinese coast, e.g., Bohai Sea Coastal current, Yellow Sea Coastal Current, Jiangsu Coastal Current, Zhejian-Fujian Coastal Current, Yuedong Coastal Current) along the east coast and over inner and middle shelves (Lie & Cho, 2016).

Western Kuroshio Branch (WKB) is born at the continental slope northeast of Taiwan to carry Kuroshio water to the western East China Sea shelf.  Eastern Kuroshio Branch (EKB) is born at continental slope southwest of Kyushu to carry Kuroshio water to the eastern East China Sea shelf.  Its secondary branches south of Jeju-do include: 1: Tsushima Warm Current (TWC) flowing in the East China/Japan seas through the Korea-Tsushima Straits; 2: Cheju Warm Current (CWC) rounding Jeju-do clockwise eventually turning into the northern Okinawa Trough west of Kyushu, forming the Western Kyushu Current (WKC); and 3: Yellow Sea Warm Current (YSWC) flowing northward in winter monsoon from CWC at the Yellow Sea entrance west of Jeju-do.

Coastal currents on the inner shelf and the shallow part of the middle shelf in general are seasonal, with large variations in current direction and speed.  In winter they tend to flow southward along the Chinese and Korean coasts; in summer the currents are reversed in direction along the western coast of Korea and southeastern Chinese coast south of the Changjiang River mouth.  In summer less-saline water coming from the South China Sea flows through the Taiwan Strait and then spreads eastward over the western East China Sea.

Bohai Sea is a semi-enclosed and shallow bay connected on its east side with the Yellow Sea (Song et al., 2017).  The current system in Bohai Sea is mainly composed of the continuation of the YSWC from the Yellow Sea which entering the Bohai Sea through the northern part of the Bohai Strait and the outgoing Yellow Sea Coastal Current through the southern part of Bohai Strait to the Yellow Sea.  The Bohai Sea is characterized to have strong winter gales which can greatly enhance the water exchange.

The following discussion about the distribution of some calanoid species in the China seas, unless otherwise mentioned, is based on Chen, Q. (1992).

*Calanus sinicus* is a high saline and high thermal species and a major species of zooplankton in the open central waters of Bohai Sea, Yellow Sea, and East China Sea.  Its distribution extends to the north coast of South China Sea in winter, however, losing its dominancy in the zooplankton community.  The expansion and reduction of distribution of *C. sinicus* are highly related to the oceanography of the area* *(Hwang & Wong, 2005).  *C. sinicus* breeds in May/June, August, and November in the Bohai Sea and northern Yellow Sea, slightly earlier in March/April, July/August, and October in the southern Yellow Sea, in April, June/July, and October in the East China Sea, and slightly later in April/May, July/August, and January in the Taiwan Strait.  There are only two breeding seasons in the Guangdong coastal waters and the Beibu Gulf of the South China Sea.  The change in breeding seasons in different seas is apparently related to the water temperature, and therefore ocean currents.  Increase of zooplankton biomass in the China seas corresponds with breeding season of the copepods.

In the Bohai Sea, *Calanus sinicus* is common throughout the year. It is predominant in summer and fall in the central part.  In late spring to early summer its dominancy expands to the coastal waters due to the influence of the inward drifting Yellow Sea Warm Current.

In the Yellow Sea, *Calanus sinicus* is always abundant in the central open waters and is a representative species in spring, summer, and autumn.  In late spring to early summer the shoreward expansion of high saline water carries *C. sinicus* to the Shandong coastal area.  In summer and fall, owing to the expansion of the less saline coastal waters, *C. sinicus *is forced to retreat toward central part.

*Calanus sinicus* is a dominant species throughout the year in the open waters of the East China Sea.  Its distribution expands to the coastal waters from the Changjiang River mouth to Taiwan Strait in winter when Changjiang River runoff is weakened and influence of NE monsoon and the China Coastal Current is strengthened.

In winter, and extending to spring, influenced by the China Coastal Current and enforced by the NE monsoon, *Calanus sinicus* is drifted to the coastal waters of Guangdong and may be as far west as the Beibu Gulf, a gulf surrounded by Vietnam and China (three provinces: Guangxi, Guangdong and Hainan).

*Labidocera euchaeta* is, similar to *Calanus sinicus, *also recorded in all China seas.  However, it is a species of low saline waters and, different from *C. sinicus*, is more abundant in coastal waters than in open seas.  It is a dominant species in the coastal waters of northern Liaoning Peninsula and Laizhou Gulf in the Bohai Sea, and southern Liaoning Peninsula in the Yellow Sea.  Its dominance in the northern Liaoning coastal water is replaced by *C. sinicus* in late spring and early summer due to the strengthening Yellow Sea Warm Current.  In the East China Sea, *L. euchaeta* is a dominant species in the coastal waters, especially a year round dominant species in the Changjiang River mouth.  In the South China Sea it is abundant in the coastal waters of Guangdong Province.

*Euchaeta concinna* is a tropical species and spreads over South China Sea, Taiwan Strait, and East China Sea.  Less frequently it expands to the southern Yellow Sea by the influence of Yellow Sea Warm Current.  In the South China Sea, it is a major component of the subsurface zooplankton community, and abundant in the northern South China Sea where oceanic and coastal waters mix.  It is a dominant species on the west coast of Taiwan Strait in summer but is forced to bottom water when the Kuroshio Branch Current sinks in the area west of Taiwan in winter.

*Subeucalanus subcrassus* is a tropical species and present in both oceanic and coastal waters from the South China Sea to East China Sea, and, to a less extent, the southern Yellow Sea due to the influence of northward drifting Yellow Sea Warm Current in fall and winter.  In the South China Sea, *S. subcrassus* has been recorded from open waters in central South China Sea to near shore waters south of Guangdong Province and as well as in the Beibu Gulf and Thailand Gulf.  From the northeastern South China Sea northward, *S. subcrassus* is abundant in the Taiwan Strait, especially in summer, and widely distributed and dominant in fall in the East China Sea.  It is also fairly abundant in the in the Ilan Bay, east of Taiwan (Lee et al. 2009).

The composition of calanoid copepods in the China seas is strongly influenced by the Kuroshio.  Grice (1962) studied the copepods of the equatorial Pacific.  He recorded 109 species of calanoid copepods in his survey.  All but four (*Aetideus pacificus, Pleuromamma indica, Parvocalanus dubia* and *Scopalatum smithae*) of the species reported by him also occur in the China seas.  There may have more species that are common in the equatorial Pacific and the China seas if more collections from the equatorial water are available for study.  This is a clear indication that the Kuroshio, due to its upstream the North Pacific Equitorial Current, is an important contributor to the composition of calanoid copepods in the China seas.  Further comparison of the equatorial copepod species with the copepod species recorded in the different China seas.
